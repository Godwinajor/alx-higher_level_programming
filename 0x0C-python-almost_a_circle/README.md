1. Base class
mandatory
Write the first class Base:

Create a folder named models with an empty file __init__.py inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package

Create a file named models/base.py:

Class Base:
private class attribute __nb_objects = 0
class constructor: def __init__(self, id=None)::
if id is not None, assign the public instance attribute id with this argument value - you can assume id is an integer and you don’t need to test the type of it
otherwise, increment __nb_objects and assign the new value to the public instance attribute id
This class will be the “base” of all other classes in this project. The goal of it is to manage id attribute in all your future classes and to avoid duplicating the same code (by extension, same bugs)
2. First Rectangle
mandatory
Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:

In the file models/rectangle.py
Class Rectangle inherits from Base
Private instance attributes, each with its own public getter and setter:
__width -> width
__height -> height
__x -> x
__y -> y
Class constructor: def __init__(self, width, height, x=0, y=0, id=None):
Call the super class with id - this super call with use the logic of the __init__ of the Base class
Assign each argument width, height, x and y to the right attribute
Why private attributes with getter/setter? Why not directly public attribute?

Because we want to protect attributes of our class. With a setter, you are able to validate what a developer is trying to assign to a variable. So after, in your class you can “trust” these attributes.
3. Validate attributes
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded):

If the input is not an integer, raise the TypeError exception with the message: <name of the attribute> must be an integer. Example: width must be an integer
If width or height is under or equals 0, raise the ValueError exception with the message: <name of the attribute> must be > 0. Example: width must be > 0
If x or y is under 0, raise the ValueError exception with the message: <name of the attribute> must be >= 0. Example: x must be >= 0
4. Area first
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 3-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" 3-main """
from models.rectangle import Rectangle

if __name__ == "__main__":

    r1 = Rectangle(3, 2)
    print(r1.area())

    r2 = Rectangle(2, 10)
    print(r2.area())

    r3 = Rectangle(8, 7, 0, 0, 12)
    print(r3.area())

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./3-main.py
6
20
56

5. Display #0
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you don’t need to handle x and y here.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 4-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" 4-main """
from models.rectangle import Rectangle

if __name__ == "__main__":

    r1 = Rectangle(4, 6)
    r1.display()

    print("---")

    r1 = Rectangle(2, 2)
    r1.display()

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./4-main.py
